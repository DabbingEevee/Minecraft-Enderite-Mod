# Enderite Mod

## Description

The Enderite Mod adds new armor and tools which are the successors of Netherite tools.
The ore can be found in the end (heights 12-48) and needs to be exploded before it can be mined.
You can blast smelt the ore to get scraps which you can craft with diamonds to Enderite Ingots (like Netherite).
With these ingots you can craft Enderite tools and blocks, which all have the void float ability.
### Void float ability
- no gravity
- they avoid the void (y<0) and float above it, even after a player has fallen out of the world
- also Netherite ability: fireproof
### Special items/blocks
- Enderite Shulker Box: more safe alternative than normal shulker box, because of void float
- Enderite Respawn Anchor: allows respawns in end (filled up with ender pearls)
- Enderite Sword: Can be charged with ender pearls, lets you teleport with sneak + right click
- Enderite Elytra Chestplate: Basically the Enderite Chestplate fused with the elytra, allows for armor and eyltra flight
